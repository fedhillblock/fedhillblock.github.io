  <h2>Dear neighbor,</h2>
  <p>Providence mayor Brett Smiley is trying again to convert the Lauro School into a private charter.</p>
  <p>Under the Lauro conversion scheme, endorsed and originally put forth by Smiley, the city would sign a renewable 35-year lease with Excel Academy, funneling taxpayer dollars into a private system that is not accountable to the school board, whose staff and teachers are not unionized, and whose syllabi and strict rules are set by an unelected administration. Charters take around $22,000 of taxpayer money per pupil out of public schools; a single charter can cost the community many millions of dollars.</p>
  <p>This same mayor recently took a week-long trip to Israel — supporting a country that is, according to scholars and Amnesty International, perpetrating a genocide.</p>
  <p>In just the week of the mayor’s vacation last May, hundreds of Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes. The Gaza dead — some estimate over 80,000 so far, with thousands more buried or missing — include doctors, journalists, civil servants, and aid workers. Around 80% of those martyred in Gaza are women and children (according to the UN, the most common age group among the dead: 5 to 9 years old). Israel has bombed apartments, infrastructure, schools, universities, refugee camps, churches, mosques, and designated “safe zones”: all blatant evidence of genocidal intent, not just to destroy lives, but to destroy a nation in its entirety.</p>
  <p>“It was personally very moving for me,” Smiley said, recounting to local television reporters stories of wine dinners he had in Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, Smiley has slandered local pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. He effectively banned displays of the Palestinian flag over city hall, claiming this “fans the flames” of conflict. Smiley, a proud Zionist, has flown the Israeli flag over city hall multiple times, once to commemorate Israel’s founding as a state (which entailed the violent displacement of around 750,000 Arab people from their land). Like Donald Trump, Brett Smiley fancies himself a steadfast ally of Israel — even as it leads an extermination campaign. And, also like Trump, Smiley would like to further privatize public education.</p>

	<h1>War abroad, capitalism at home — this is the mayor’s ideology.</h1>
	<p>Smiley's support for charters and his normalization of genocide are part and parcel of anti-people policies across the board.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ANTI-TENANT. Smiley opposes rent control. His housing policy revolves around handouts to developers. Under the mayor, Providence has become the most unaffordable city for renters in the country.</li>
    <li>ANTI-WORKER. Smiley sent cops to striking Butler Hospital employees and fined them hundreds of dollars for being “too loud.”</li>
    <li>REPRESSIVE. Smiley has added hundreds of new officers and a tank to the cops’ arsenal and secured a record-breaking police budget. He lied about PPD collaborating with ICE, and oversaw a horrific episode of police brutality on July 3rd.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>And the fight next door shows how Smiley is  ANTI-STUDENT.</p>

<h1>Save the Carl G. Lauro school building!</h1>
  <p>A tiered, unequal system is developing within our education system: Charters like Excel exclude many of the poorest and neediest students, including disabled students and students who are housing or food insecure, whose parents may not be as likely to go through a bureaucratic application process, or who may be put off by the charter’s “no excuses” regime — in which students are penalized and expelled for minor infractions.</p>
   <p>In fact, brutality is the secret to Excel’s culture of “achievement”: Excel’s network-wide suspension rate is 14%, and the rate at their first Rhode Island school during their opening year was closer to 30% — double or quadruple that of the public school system, who are left to pick up the pieces.</p>
  <p>Under the plan, half of the Lauro school would become a “swing space” for Providence Schools, who would rent from Excel. Public school students would then be at the beck and call of new private landlords, controlling when and how to use the classrooms, gym, playground, and cafeteria. This is partly why many Providence Teachers Union (PTU) members and public school parents oppose the plan.</p>
<p><img src="/pics/collage1.jpg" alt="photo collage of Lauro school building details" width="100%"></p>
  <p>As neighbors, we will have to navigate TWO schools crammed into one, each with their own pick-up and drop-off times. Remember long lines of buses? Roads at a standstill? The battle over parking spaces? With two parallel school systems, each with their own parents and staff, we can expect double the chaos.</p>
  <p>Parents of kids at Asa Messer, who would use part of Lauro while renovations are made at their own school, worry about construction, dust, and the general safety of children. Who knows what renovations will be made by Excel and when? This deal puts such questions beyond the public purview.</p>
  <p>In fact, there has been no democratic process, no city notices, no talk among the neighborhood about how a public building, built and maintained by our tax dollars for 100 years, should be used. To Smiley and co., working behind the scenes with charter school interests, this question has already been answered. Abutters, Federal Hill residents, and the general community? Apparently, our involvement and input isn’t necessary.</p>
  <p>Stop the Wait, a pro-charter lobby and dark money front, is working hard to promote this lease. They claim Excel Academy is “public,” even though it’s privately run and has no democratic oversight. They claim it’s better to have “choice” in education. But choice doesn’t make sense for universal goods, where everyone deserves the best (especially when running dual systems comes with such a high cost). They say they want to take “politics” out of education. But how is the question of who gets what — and how our dwindling civic spaces are used — not political?</p>

  <p>Look around. While our tax dollars fund genocide abroad, at home we’re faced with crumbling sidewalks and roads. Missing signs. Rats. Litter. A housing and homelessness crisis. Neighbors evicted. People dying from rough sleeping outdoors. Public schools neglected and closed down. Smiley’s answer to this is more capitalism: A blank check for cops, handouts to developers, and austerity and sleazy “public-private partnerships” when it comes to basic city services.</p>
  <p>The Lauro building was built and maintained over decades through public tax dollars to serve the community. Let’s keep Lauro public and stop charter expansion!</p>
