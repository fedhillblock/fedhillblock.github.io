  <h2>Dear neighbor,</h2>
  <p>Providence mayor Brett Smiley is taking a second a swing at his plan to reconvert the Lauro school into a private charter.</p>
  <p>This is the same mayor who recently took a fawning, week-long tour in Israel — a country that is, according to scholars and Amnesty International, perpetrating a genocide.</p>
  <p text-align:center><img src="/pics/smiley.png" alt="screen capture of a tweet by mayor Smiley that displays the Israeli flag with the caption 'Providence stands with Israel'" width="65%"></p>
  <p>In just the week of the mayor’s vacation last May, hundreds of Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes. The Gaza dead — some estimate over 80,000 so far, with thousands more buried or missing — include doctors, journalists, civil servants, and aid workers. Around 80% of those martyred in Gaza are women and children. According to the UN, the most common age group among the dead: 5 to 9 years old. Israel has bombed apartments, infrastructure, schools, universities, refugee camps, churches, mosques, and designated “safe zones”: all blatant evidence of genocidal intent, not just to destroy lives, but to destroy a nation in its entirety.</p>
  <p>“It was personally very moving for me,” Smiley said, recounting to local television reporters stories of wine dinners he had in Tel Aviv.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Smiley has slandered local pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. He effectively banned displays of the Palestinian flag over city hall, claiming this “fans the flames” of conflict. Smiley, a proud Zionist, has flown the Israeli flag over city hall multiple times, once to commemorate Israel’s founding as a state (which involved the violent displacement of around 750,000 Arab people from the land of Palestine). Like Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, J.D. Vance, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the bipartisan establishment, Brett Smiley fancies himself a steadfast ally and supporter of Israel — even as it leads an extermination campaign.</p>
  <p>Smiley shares another thing with the political establishment: a passion for free-market capitalism and its repressive arms.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ANTI-TENANT. He opposes rent control. His housing policy revolves around handouts to developers. Under Smiley, Providence has become the most unaffordable city for renters in the country.</li>
    <li>ANTI-WORKER. Smiley sent cops to striking Butler Hospital employees and fined them hundreds of dollars for being “too loud.”</li>
    <li>REPRESSIVE. Smiley has added hundreds of new officers and a tank to the cops’ arsenal and secured a record-breaking police budget. He lied about PPD collaborating with ICE, and oversaw a horrific episode of police brutality on July 3rd.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>And the fight next door shows how Smiley is  ANTI-STUDENT.</p>
  <p>Under the conversion scheme, endorsed (and originally put forth by) Smiley, the city would sign a 35-year lease with Excel Academy, funneling taxpayer dollars into a private system that is not accountable to the school board, whose staff and teachers are not unionized, and whose syllabi and strict rules are set by an unelected administration. Charters take $22,000 per pupil out of public schools; a single charter can cost the community many millions of dollars.</p>
  <p>A tiered, unequal system has developed: Charters like Excel informally and formally exclude many of the poorest and neediest students, including disabled students, whose parents may not be as likely to go through a bureaucratic application process, or who may be put off by the charter’s “no excuses” regime — penalizing and expelling students for minor infractions. Brutality is the secret to Excel’s culture of “achievement”: Their network-wide suspension rate is 14%, well over double that of the public school system, who are left to pick up the pieces.</p>
  <p>Under the plan, half of the Lauro school would be a “swing space” for Providence Schools, who must rent from Excel. Public school students would then be at the beck and call of new private landlords, controlling when and how to use the classrooms, gym, playground, and cafeteria. This is partly why many Providence Teachers Union (PTU) members and public school parents oppose the plan.</p>
  <p>As neighbors, we will have to navigate TWO schools crammed into one, each with their own pick-up and drop-off times. Remember long lines of buses? Roads at a standstill? The battle over parking spaces? With two parallel school systems, each with their own parents and staff, we can expect double the chaos.</p>
  <p>Parents of kids at Asa Messer, who would use part of Lauro while renovations are made at their own school, worry about construction, dust, and the general safety of children. Who knows what renovations will be made by Excel and when? This deal puts such questions beyond the public purview.</p>
  <p>In fact, there has been no democratic process, no city notices, no talk among the neighborhood about how a public building, built and maintained by our tax dollars, should be used. To Smiley and co., working behind the scenes with charter school interests, this question has already been answered. Abutters, Federal Hill residents, and the general community? Apparently, our involvement and input isn’t necessary.</p>
  <p>Stop the Wait, a pro-charter lobby and dark money front, is working hard to promote this lease. They claim Excel Academy is “public,” even though it’s privately run and has no democratic oversight. They claim it’s better to have “choice” in education. But choice doesn’t make sense for universal goods, where everyone deserves the best (especially when running dual systems comes with such a high cost). They say they want to take “politics” out of education. But how is the question of who gets what — and how our dwindling civic spaces are used — not political?</p>
  <p>Look around. While our tax dollars fund genocide abroad, at home we’re faced with crumbling sidewalks and roads. Missing signs. Rats. Litter. A housing and homelessness crisis. Neighbors evicted. People dying from rough sleeping outdoors. Public schools neglected and closed down. Smiley’s answer to this is more capitalism: A blank check for cops, handouts to developers, and austerity and sleazy “public-private partnerships” when it comes to basic city services.</p>
  <p>The Lauro building was built and maintained over decades through public tax dollars to serve the community. Let’s keep Lauro public and stop charter expansion!</p>
